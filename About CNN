CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK


CNN is a Deep Learning algorithm designed for processing structured arrays of data such as images.It takes in an input image, assign weights and biases to various objects/aspects in the image and be able to differentiate from one another.
It operates directky on a raw image and do not need any preprocessing.


2D convolution layer (Convo2D): This layer creates a convolution kernel that is convolved with the layer input to produce a tensor of outputs.

Flatten layer in Keras: A flatten operation on a tensor reshapes the tensor to have the shape that is equal to the number of elements  contained in the tensor non-including the batch dimwnsion.

Max Pooling : It is done to help overfitting by providing an abstracted form of representation. As well, it reduces the computational cost by reducing the number of parameters to learn and provides basic translation invariance to the internal reprsentation.

Pooling layer: A pooling layer is a building block of a CNN. Its function is to progressively reduce the spatial size of the representation to reduce amount of parameters and computation in the network.It works on each feature independently.

Dense layer: Each neuron in a layer receives input from all the neurons present in the previous layer. thus they're densely connected. That is all the neurons in a layer are connected to those in the next layer.  

Important terms:
kernel_initializer: Initializer for the kernel weight matrix.
